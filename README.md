# DaisoUi
Started creating a Ui Design for Daiso. 


This is a project I'm working on for fun. I believe that by creating this, it'll expand my Ui Design portfolio.

As an employee there, I wanted to design this to demonstrate my knowledge in customer service. Their website currently has a lot of flaws
and needs a lot of redesign. Their first website years ago was visually not appealing. They currently have a new design but is still
lacking in design.

I wanted to create this basic app to help customers use their app with ease. Daiso has a lot of products and is always making new products
to meet demands. Without a proper structure, it'll be hard for customers to understand where to look for items. 

With my design, I created basic categories based on my knowledge working there. We split all sections into these basic categories:

Stationery, Food, Beauty, Bath, Health, Travel, Clothing, Seasonal, Ceramics, Home, Living, Gardening, Pets, Toys, Household, Plastic and Kitchen.
